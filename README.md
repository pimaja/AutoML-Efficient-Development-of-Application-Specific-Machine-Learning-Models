# AutoML-Efficient-Development-of-Application-Specific-Machine-Learning-Models

One-sentence Summary: We explore the use of constraint active search for hyperparameter optimization considering accuracy, but also inference time, peak memory consumption and storage memory of a convolutional neural network, to make it deployable on an edge device. 
  
Keywords: AutoML, edge devices, edge ML, hyperparameter optimization, constraint active search, inference time, peak memory consumption, storage memory, convolutional neural network.

The code consist of the main Jupyter notebook "AutoML_2022_Efficient Development of Application Specific Machine Learning Models.ipynb", and the additional "comparing_memory_and_inference_time.ipynb". All of the necessary installations are provided in the notebooks. Additionally, it is necessary to use a GPU and make a free SigOpt account to receive an own API token to connect to the platform.

Results of the conducted experiments are available in .csv format in the folder "results".
